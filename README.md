# Big-Data-Financial-Classification
Big Data Financial Classification Application  This project involved the development of a Big Data Financial Classification application using Pyspark, Pyspark-ml, and Power BI. The goal of the project was to analyze and visualize three financial data sets in order to extract insights and trends.  To begin, my teammate used Pyspark to load and preprocess the data. This included tasks such as cleaning and formatting the data, as well as selecting relevant features for analysis. I and my teammate then used Pyspark-ml to perform various machine learning techniques on the data, including classification algorithms such as logistic regression and random forests.  Once the analysis was complete, then I used Power BI to create visualizations of the results. This allowed me to easily communicate my findings and present them in a clear and concise manner.  Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience as it allowed me to gain experience in using these powerful Big Data tools to extract insights and trends from financial data.
